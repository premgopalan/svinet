Installation
------------

Required libraries: gsl, gslblas, pthread

On Linux/Unix run

 ./configure
 make; make install

On Mac OS, the location of the required gsl, gslblas and pthread
libraries may need to be specified:

 ./configure LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include"
 make; make install

The binary 'svinet' will be installed in /usr/local/bin unless a
different prefix is provided to configure. (See INSTALL.)

Tutorial
--------

1. Prepare your network data as a tab-separated file (e.g., network.txt)

2. Run the following command to find the overlapping communities: 

     svinet -file network.txt -n 10000 -k 75 -link-sampling

3. Run the following command to visualize the communities:
   
     cd output-dir; svinet -file ../network.txt  -n 10000 -k 75 -gml

In step 2, "-n" specifies the number of nodes, "-k" specifies the
number of communities and "-link-sampling" specifies the sampling
method.
   
Step 2 writes out the communities in communities.txt, the model fit in
gamma.txt and lambda.txt and the mixed-memberships in groups.txt.

Step 3 writes out a GML file (network.gml) that can be loaded into a
tool, such as Gephi, to visualize the communities. Note that each node
is colored by its most likely community in the visualization.

Some advanced tips
------------------

1. *Estimating the number of communities*

   Run the following command setting the number of communities equal
   to the number of nodes:

   svinet -file network.txt  -n 10000 -k 10000 -findk

   Estimate the number of communities using the following:

   wc -l n10000-k10000-mmsb-findk-uniform/communities.txt

   Specify this count as the number of communities in step 2 in the tutorial.

2. *Comparing communities to the ground truth*

   If you have a text file with ground truth community labels, you can
   specify it in step 2 above, to compute a normalized mutual
   information score between the true communities and the inferred
   communities. Run the command in step 2 as follows:

     svinet -file network.txt -n 10000 -k 75 -link-sampling -nmi community.txt

   The format of the ground truth community file is as follows:

   node1    <list of communities node1 is a member of>

   e.g., 
   65	 17 22 43 54

   The above line says node with id 65 is a member of communities 17,
   22, 43, 54. The community ids are arbitrary. See detailed_readme.txt.

3. *Comparing communities to results from other methods*

   We recommend running svinet with two settings of the
   **link threshold** as follows:

     svinet -file network.txt -n 10000 -k 75 -link-sampling -link-thresh 0.5

     svinet -file network.txt -n 10000 -k 75 -link-sampling -link-thresh 0.9

   For further details, see detailed_readme.txt or please email the authors.

4. *Set an alternate prior on community strengths*

   The "fromdata" option sets a prior based on the network data on the
   community strengths and may result in better communities. By
   default, the prior on community strenths is a uniform distribution.

     svinet -file network.txt -n 10000 -k 75 -link-sampling -eta-type fromdata

5. *Other sampling methods*

   See detailed_readme.txt.
