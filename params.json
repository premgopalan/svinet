{"name":"Svinet","tagline":"This package implements algorithms for identifying overlapping communities in large undirected networks. The sampling based algorithms derive from stochastic variational inference under the (assortative) mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel.

(See INSTALL.)\r\n\r\nTutorial\r\n--------\r\n\r\n1. Prepare your network data as a tab-separated file (e.g., network.txt)\r\n\r\n2. Run the following command to find the overlapping communities: \r\n\r\n     svinet -file network.txt -n 10000 -k 75 -link-sampling\r\n\r\n3. Run the following command to visualize the communities:\r\n   \r\n     cd output-dir; svinet -file ../network.txt  -n 10000 -k 75 -gml\r\n\r\nIn step 2, \"-n\" specifies the number of nodes, \"-k\" specifies the\r\nnumber of communities and \"-link-sampling\" specifies the sampling\r\nmethod.\r\n   \r\nStep 2 writes out the communities in communities.txt, the model fit in\r\ngamma.txt and lambda.txt and the mixed-memberships in groups.txt.\r\n\r\nStep 3 writes out a GML file (network.gml) that can be loaded into a\r\ntool, such as Gephi, to visualize the communities. Note that each node\r\nis colored by its most likely community in the visualization.\r\n\r\nSome advanced tips\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n1. *Estimating the number of communities*\r\n\r\n   Run the following command setting the number of communities equal\r\n   to the number of nodes:\r\n\r\n   svinet -file network.txt  -n 10000 -k 10000 -findk\r\n\r\n   Estimate the number of communities using the following:\r\n\r\n   wc -l n10000-k10000-mmsb-findk-uniform/communities.txt\r\n\r\n   Specify this count as the number of communities in step 2 in the tutorial.\r\n\r\n2. *Comparing communities to the ground truth*\r\n\r\n   If you have a text file with ground truth community labels, you can\r\n   specify it in step 2 above, to compute a normalized mutual\r\n   information score between the true communities and the inferred\r\n   communities. Run the command in step 2 as follows:\r\n\r\n     svinet -file network.txt -n 10000 -k 75 -link-sampling -nmi community.txt\r\n\r\n   The format of the ground truth community file is as follows:\r\n\r\n   node1    <list of communities node1 is a member of>\r\n\r\n   e.g., \r\n   65\t 17 22 43 54\r\n\r\n   The above line says node with id 65 is a member of communities 17,\r\n   22, 43, 54. The community ids are arbitrary. See detailed_readme.txt.\r\n\r\n3. *Comparing communities to results from other methods*\r\n\r\n   We recommend running svinet with two settings of the\r\n   **link threshold** as follows:\r\n\r\n     svinet -file network.txt -n 10000 -k 75 -link-sampling -link-thresh 0.5\r\n\r\n     svinet -file network.txt -n 10000 -k 75 -link-sampling -link-thresh 0.9\r\n\r\n   For further details, see detailed_readme.txt or please email the authors.\r\n\r\n4. *Set an alternate prior on community strengths*\r\n\r\n   The \"fromdata\" option sets a prior based on the network data on the\r\n   community strengths and may result in better communities. By\r\n   default, the prior on community strenths is a uniform distribution.\r\n\r\n     svinet -file network.txt -n 10000 -k 75 -link-sampling -eta-type fromdata\r\n\r\n5. *Other sampling methods*\r\n\r\n   See detailed_readme.txt.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n[![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/premgopalan/svinet/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free \"Bitdeli Badge\")\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
